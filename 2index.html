<h1><i>ABOUT ME</i></h1>
<p>
    My full name is Magan Simone Thomas-Copland. I was born in Oklahoma on March 3rd 1999. My two parents Hattie Thomas and Robin Copland adopted me when I was 6 days old.
</p>

<p>
    I lived in Manhattan for 11 years of my life and then moved to Maine. I am very glad that I moved to Maine, because it is a lot better than living in the city.
</p>

<p>
    I have a dog named Brownie. He is 6 years old. Funny story, he was born dark brown but as he got older he changed colors to snow white. His name doesn't fit him anymore.
</p>

<p>
    I want to work at a company that my dad is Vice President at. The Company is called Huge and it is linked on my homepage.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Mexico</li>
    <li>Bahamas</li>
    <li>Canada</li>
    <li>Hawaii</li>

</ul>
